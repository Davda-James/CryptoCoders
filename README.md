Research AI Agent

## Agent
-   So we are using **heurist AI agent framework** for using agents and building using it. It provides a variety of agents to work upon like Deep Reasearch Agent , telegram agent and much more etc.

## Install requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required .env
-   There is example.env file, rename it to .env and add values to the required env variables.

## Backend 

### How to set up the backend which exposes the API's to call agents ?
```bash
python app.py
```

This will run the server and host the backend along with agents locally and then frontend can request upon this backend.
